        <meta name="description" content="Brooklyn Broke The Universe is a series about Brooklyn Woods, 
            a 23-year-old minimum-wage-working and part-time music producer who can barely afford rent. 
            Things haven't gone her way her entire life, and just as things are starting to look up, 
            her life is flipped completely on its head as she's whisked away into another universe to help 
            prevent the annihilation of everything that is, was, or will be. As it would for anyone, going 
            from a retail job to full-time interdimensional superhero takes... quite a toll on her. But luckily, 
            she has another version of herself named Terra Woods, the lead agent of the Multiverse Observation 
            Bureau (MOB), to guide her through the complexities of this new life.
            
            Navigating the multiverse can be hard, but navigating life is harder.">
